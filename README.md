# star-wars-scroll-meteor

This is my first attempt at two major goals- 1) creating an app with meteor, 2) working with data delivered via api.

The content comes from the good folks over at The Star Wars API - http://swapi.co and the app was created intially as a weather app from a video by George Mcknight and his Meteor video located here www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCVDTFuLvyo
